Lab 2: Identifying ML Problems, Selecting Open
Datasets, and Drawing a Methodology Diagram

Objectives:

-1 Choosing an Open Dataset
-2 Defining the Machine Learning Problem
-3 Loading and Inspecting the Dataset in Python
-4 Designing the Methodology Diagram


Your GitHub repository must contain:
• A short written summary describing the dataset and the machine learning problem:

Short Summary

This dataset contains COVID-19 case numbers in the United States along with human mobility indicators for the year 2021.
The goal of this project is to predict the number of COVID-19 cases based on mobility and related features.
This is a supervised regression problem because the target variable, cases, is a continuous numerical value.

• A Jupyter Notebook that loads the dataset and displays basic information
• The methodology diagram saved as an image or PDF
